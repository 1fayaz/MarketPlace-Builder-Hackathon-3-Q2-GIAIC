🔗 Hackathon Day 3 – API Integration and Data Migration 🔗

The momentum continues on Day 3 of my week-long hackathon! Today’s focus was on bridging the gap between planning and execution by diving deep into API Integration and Data Migration. 🚀

This critical phase involved a series of key tasks to ensure the backend and frontend systems communicate effectively while handling data seamlessly:

1️⃣ Understanding APIs:

I began by thoroughly analyzing the third-party APIs chosen during the planning phase—breaking down their functionality, exploring endpoints, and reviewing their documentation to ensure seamless integration into the platform.

2️⃣ Validating and Adjusting Schema:

To align with the API’s requirements and the platform’s data flow, I reviewed and refined the schema defined earlier. This step ensured all entities were correctly mapped and relationships were effectively structured for real-world use.

3️⃣ Data Migration:

Migrating data can be complex, but it’s a vital step in ensuring the platform operates smoothly. I worked on migrating data securely and effectively while ensuring compatibility with the schema and APIs.

4️⃣ API Integration in Next.js:

Finally, I integrated the APIs into the Next.js application, establishing connections for dynamic functionalities like payments, live tracking, shipment updates, and authentication. This involved careful testing and debugging to ensure endpoints were functioning as expected in a real-world context.

This hands-on experience has not only deepened my technical skills but also strengthened my problem-solving approach when tackling challenges in a fast-paced environment.

I’d like to extend my gratitude to my incredible mentors and teachers, 

sir Ameen Alam
sir Hamza Alvi
sir Fahad Khan
sir Asharib Ali

 for their guidance throughout this journey. Your support inspires me to continually learn and grow! 🙌

Excited to see how this foundation evolves into tangible results as we move further into the hackathon! Stay tuned for more updates.
