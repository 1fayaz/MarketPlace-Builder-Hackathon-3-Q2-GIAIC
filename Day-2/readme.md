🔧 Hackathon Day 2 – Planning the Technical Foundation 🔧

The journey continues! 🚀 On Day 2 of this exciting hackathon, the focus shifted towards meticulously planning the technical foundation of our marketplace platform. This phase was all about defining the tools, technologies, and strategies that will drive development and ensure a seamless user experience.

Here’s what we accomplished today:

Frontend Development: Strategized the user-facing components to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience.

Sanity CMS: Selected as the central content management system for dynamic and flexible content handling.

Third-Party APIs Integration: Identified APIs for crucial functionalities:
Payments 🛒

Shipment Tracking 📦

Google Geolocation and Live Tracking 📍

Authentication 🔒

We took a deep dive into defining API requirements—listing endpoints, specifying methods, and detailing their functionalities. This ensures a clear communication flow between the frontend and backend. To keep things hands-on, I documented all of this alongside snapshots of the schema code, aligning technical details with development goals.

The technical roadmap was also laid out, focusing on core development stages:

Product Management: Ensuring easy handling of products in the marketplace.

Cart and Wishlist: Building a user-centric shopping experience.

Payments: Prioritizing secure, fast, and reliable transactions.

Shipment Tracking: Offering real-time updates for seamless deliveries.

Authentication: Strengthening user data privacy and security.

We also categorized the platform’s lifecycle stages into Alpha, Beta, and Sigma, which will guide the iterative development and testing process, ensuring the platform evolves into a robust solution over time.

I’m incredibly grateful to my mentors and teachers for their unwavering support and guidance throughout this journey:
